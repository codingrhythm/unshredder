Instagram Engineering Challenge: The Unshredder
-----------------------------------------------

This is a python script I wrote that unshreds the random shredded photo.
This is a [challenge](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder) from Instagram Engineering Blog.

Usage
_____

1. Run `shred.py` to shred photos from original folder. The outputs will be in shredded folder.
2. Run `unshred.py` to restore photos from shredded folder. Restored photos will be in unshredded folder.

The script will also detect the width of shreds and number of shreds automatically.
